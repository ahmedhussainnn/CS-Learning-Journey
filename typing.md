 Dear Professor Mahdavi,

I am pleased to share an overview of my recent progress concerning our ongoing project, particularly focusing on touch typing speed and accuracy. Over the past few months, I have committed myself to improving my touch typing skills, striving for higher efficiency and precision. I believe the attached table showcasing my performance evolution provides valuable insights regarding my commitment and growth in this area.


As demonstrated in the table, I began around mid-June 2023 with a words per minute (WPM) average of about 38.1 and a relatively high error rate of 8.5%. By remaining diligent and continuing my daily practices, I managed to significantly enhance my productivity while reducing mistakes. I reached a peak WPM score of approximately 42.0 and lowered the error rate below 5% by early January 2024.

In summary, I achieved an increase in WPM of almost 11% compared to my starting point, accompanied by a substantial reduction in error ratesâ€”almost halving them in less than six months. Such remarkable gains suggest that my focused approach has paid off handsomely. Moreover, given the direct correlation between efficient input methods and enhanced computational problem solving, I firmly believe these developments will positively impact my progress as a software developer.

To maintain momentum, I intend to continue refining my touch typing capabilities while embracing new challenges related to complex programming tasks. Based on my track record thus far, I expect to improve even further, ultimately with the aim of becoming one your top students.

Thank you very much for your continued support and guidance. Should you have any questions or suggestions, kindly share them with me at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Usman Hussain
